<h1> Assessment 1: Responsive Design System </h1>
<p>For this assignment, in seeking inspiration from various websites, I decided that 
  exploring architectural-design based websites would be the best idea. This decision 
  stemmed from the observation that such sites often exude a contemporary stylization, 
  aligning with the ideas I already kinda had in mind. Among the myriad of platforms 
  surveyed, the homepage of Ark Shelter emerged as a primary source of inspiration. 
  Noteworthy for its sleek modernity, the page employs captivating videography and 
  CSS transition animations that elegantly fade in upon entry, giving it this aura 
  of sophistication that I was after.

     style="float: center; margin-right: 10px;" />
  
Although trying to incorporate videography was more difficult as I couldn't find a 
video I felt was of good enough aesthetics and quality, I redirected my focus towards
  achieving an emulation of the CSS slide fade effect, a pursuit that yielded satisfactory results. 
  Despite its seemingly subtle nature, I firmly believe that this nuanced addition imparts a sense of 
  refinement and poise, qualities perfect for a project of this nature. Echoing the layout of the Ark Shelter page, 
  I opted for a horizontal navigation bar situated at the top, with the website title aligned to the left on desktops, 
  while the navigation itself remains centered. Diverging from the original design, however, I chose to maintain the 
  visibility of the navigation bar on mobile and tablet devices, avoiding the common collapsible hamburger menu for enhanced usability.

     alt="ArkHamburger"
     style="float: center; margin-right: 10px;" />
  
In keeping with a design ethos that prioritizes clarity and coherence, I adhered to a lower exposure aesthetic for the hero image, 
  complemented by crisp white text just like the Ark SHelter page did. Notably, during my exploration of architectural websites, I 
  encountered several instances of unsightly blog and article sections. Determined to make something that actually looked visually 
  appealing for this aspect of the design, I devoted considerable attention to crafting aesthetically pleasing and professional-looking 
  layouts that showcase content with finesse. After finding something I felt was going to be easy to build on to create the desired effect.

     alt="BadBlog"
     style="float: center; margin-right: 10px;" />

     alt="GoodArcticlestyle"
     style="float: center; margin-right: 10px;" />
  
Furthermore, the inclusion of an Instagram widget was deemed essential, given its relevance to the Canberra Modern page. While I aspired to 
  infuse it with a stylized aesthetic akin to the blog and events sections, the practicality of such design considerations in this instance 
  had to come before the desired aesthetics. Nonetheless, this rudimentary widget implementation I’ve slapped together serves as a foundation 
  upon which future enhancements can be built, and crucially, it facilitates the development of responsive breakpoints which was my main issue 
  when trying to facilitate visuals.
  
In making the key sections for the Canberra Modern page, I prioritized functionality and coherence. Although I envisage augmenting these
  sections with additional interactive elements, such as a button that would link to each respective other page within the site and enhanced 
  social media integration, my focus for this phase of the design process centered on establishing fundamental structures and ensuring robust 
  breakpoint functionality.
